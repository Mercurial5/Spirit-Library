Presentation layer - 6th layer of [[OSI]] model. The idea of this layer is to translate the data from the sender so that received would understand it. It's achieved by serialization and deserialization. This layer is the last layer where the data structure exists. After, there are only datagrams or packets. Encryption and Decryption is also done at this layer.
