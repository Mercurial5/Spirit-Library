Router is a physical device that transfers data between other devices in network.

Router must have two or more devices and has to be connected to two networks. 
*Example*: When you are browsing web, you are sending your request to a router, which can send it further to another device in the internet until it won't reach destination. So, in short, **router is a bridge between networks**.

[[NAT]] is used on Router.
